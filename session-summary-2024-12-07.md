# Session Summary â€” 2024-12-07

## Actions Completed
1. Converted the remaining Prisma migration scripts (`20240607083528_added_cascade_delete_for_wishlist_in_product_table` and `20240607111047_added_unique_constraint_to_name_column_in_the_category_table`) from MySQL syntax to PostgreSQL-compatible statements.
2. Ran `npx prisma migrate dev`, accepted the drift warning reset for the Railway `public` schema, and re-applied the full migration history through `20251115_add_page_view_tracking`.
3. Confirmed that the command halted while requesting a name for a new migration because Prisma still detects schema differences relative to `schema.prisma` (no new migration was created during this run).

## Current Status
- All migrations up to `20251115_add_page_view_tracking` now apply cleanly on PostgreSQL after syntax corrections.
- The development database was reset during the migrate command; existing data in the Railway `public` schema has been cleared.
- Prisma is still detecting drift between the current database schema and `schema.prisma`, awaiting a new migration file name.

## Next Steps
1. Inspect the outstanding schema changes (e.g., with `npx prisma migrate diff`) to confirm the modifications Prisma wants to capture.
2. Once the changes are validated, rerun `npx prisma migrate dev --name <meaningful_name>` (inside `server/`) to create the pending migration and complete the cycle.
3. Reseed or restore any critical data in the Railway database after the migration process succeeds.
