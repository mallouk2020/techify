# Cleanup performed â€” 2025-10-29

Summary of cleanup actions performed to prepare the repository for a clean build and deployment.

What I removed/changed:

- Removed runtime logs checked into the repo:
  - `server/logs/access.log` (deleted)
  - `server/logs/error.log` (deleted)
- Removed empty `backup.sql` at repo root (deleted).
- Ensured `.gitignore` already contains patterns to ignore runtime logs, backup files, and env files (`*.log`, `*.sql`, `.env*`).

Why:
- Runtime logs and generated backups should not be committed. They cause noisy diffs and may contain sensitive information.
- Removing them makes builds and repository size cleaner.

Next recommended steps (before deployment):

1. Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is set in Vercel to your backend host (no trailing `/api`).
2. Ensure Railway has migrations applied (use `npx prisma migrate deploy` or `node migrate-railway.js`).
3. Run a local `npm run build` and confirm success.
4. Deploy to Vercel and Railway, then test `POST /api/analytics/page-view` and `GET /api/analytics/visitors-summary`.

Notes:
- I did not delete prisma backups (`server/prisma_backup_20241209`) which may contain useful historical migration scripts.
- If you want me to archive those backups into an `archive/` folder, I can do that as a separate step.

If you'd like, I can now run the build and prepare a deployment checklist for Vercel/Railway with exact commands and logs to watch. If you want me to attempt the build now, say "Run build" and I'll start it and report the output.
