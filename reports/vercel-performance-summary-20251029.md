# Vercel Performance Summary — 2025-10-29

Source: `reports/vercel-performance-20251029.json`
Lighthouse version: 12.8.2

## Quick summary
- Test environment: Desktop user agent (Chrome 141 / Windows) with network UA simulating an Android device.
- Core performance highlights:
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP): 1.1 s — good baseline.
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 3.6 s — room for improvement (medium impact on perceived load).
  - Speed Index: 2.9 s — reasonable but tied to LCP and render-blocking assets.
- Overall: site renders quickly initially, but the largest visible element is delayed (~3.6s). Prioritize LCP and unused JS/asset reductions.

## Key metrics (from the report)
- First Contentful Paint: 1,098 ms (display: 1.1 s)
- Largest Contentful Paint: 3,637 ms (display: 3.6 s)
- Speed Index: 2,948 ms (display: 2.9 s)
- Lighthouse version: 12.8.2

> Note: these numbers are a single run; use Lighthouse/Field data to confirm real-user impact. The run included filmstrip screenshots demonstrating page progression.

## Most important issues and prioritized fixes
Priority ranking uses expected user-perceptible impact (High/Medium/Low) and estimated effort.

1) Improve LCP (High impact, Medium effort)
   - Symptoms: LCP at ~3.6s.
   - Actions:
     - Identify the LCP element (hero image, hero text block or large banner). Use the Lighthouse trace to confirm.
     - Serve LCP image in an optimized format (AVIF/WebP) and ensure correct sizing.
     - Use Next.js built-in image optimizations (next/image) or ensure critical image is priority-loaded with proper width/height and srcset.
     - Consider server-side rendering or streaming critical content so the LCP element arrives earlier.
   - Expected gain: 0.5–1.5s reduction in LCP (site dependent).

2) Reduce render-blocking JS/CSS (High impact, Medium effort)
   - Symptoms: Speed Index and LCP indicate blocking scripts/styles.
   - Actions:
     - Audit main bundle (analyze with source-map-explorer or webpack/bundle analyzer). Split vendor vs app code.
     - Defer non-critical JS, use dynamic imports for large libraries (charts, maps, admin-only code), and move non-urgent scripts to after TTFB.
     - Inline critical CSS or ensure Tailwind build extracts only used classes (purge/tree-shake) for production.
   - Expected gain: 200–1000 ms across FCP/LCP/Speed Index depending on current bundle size.

3) Optimize fonts and font loading (Medium impact, Low effort)
   - Actions:
     - Use font-display: swap for custom fonts.
     - Preload the key font(s) used by the hero (link rel=preload as font) and use font subsets for body/hero.
   - Expected gain: smoother text rendering, reduction in layout shifts.

4) Optimize images site-wide (Medium impact, Low–Medium effort)
   - Actions:
     - Compress and convert images to modern formats; enable responsive srcsets.
     - Ensure proper caching headers and CDN delivery.
     - Lazy-load below-the-fold images.
   - Expected gain: reduced network payload and faster LCP/Speed Index.

5) Caching and CDN behavior (Medium impact, Low effort)
   - Actions:
     - Ensure static assets (images, fonts, JS/CSS) have long cache TTLs and use immutable hashing.
     - Use Vercel Edge and CDN headers for dynamic routes where appropriate.
   - Expected gain: faster repeat visits and reduced server load.

6) Remove noisy/blocked external requests during build/data collection (Low impact, Low effort)
   - Observation: previously a noisy ECONNREFUSED appeared during server-side builds when analytics endpoints were offline. You already added suppression for non-hosted builds — keep that behavior and prefer safe defaults for static generation.

## Quick wins (apply within days)
- Preload hero image and key font used in header/hero.
- Audit and lazy-load third-party scripts (chat widgets, analytics) or defer them until after interactive.
- Ensure next/image usage for large product/hero images.
- Run a single bundle analysis to find the largest chunks and convert any large dependency to dynamic import.

## Recommended next steps (concrete)
1. Reproduce the audit locally with Lighthouse (CLI) and WebPageTest for consistent measurements across runs.
   - Command (optional): run Lighthouse in Chrome or use `npx lhci autorun --collect.url=https://techify-beta.vercel.app/` in CI.
2. Run a bundle analyzer (next build && analyze) to find heavy bundles; open a short ticket to split vendor code and lazy-load admin/dashboard-only chunks.
3. Prioritize LCP investigation: identify the exact LCP element and add a short ticket to optimize the asset (image/font) and/or server-side-render it.
4. Add 3 small PRs: (a) preload hero font/image, (b) lazy-load a large third-party script, (c) enable next/image for hero.

## Owner suggestions & timeline
- Sprint 1 (1–3 days): preload hero image/font, lazy-load third-party scripts, confirm caching headers.
- Sprint 2 (3–7 days): bundle analysis and code-splitting, convert critical images to AVIF/WebP and enable next/image everywhere.
- Sprint 3 (7–14 days): server-side rendering tweaks or streaming, repeat Lighthouse runs and measure improvements.

## How I validated
- Source: single Lighthouse JSON run stored at `reports/vercel-performance-20251029.json`.
- Used core metrics reported (FCP, LCP, Speed Index); filmstrip frames included in the JSON to inspect visual progress.

## Notes and assumptions
- This is a single-test snapshot; field (RUM) data may differ. Prioritize LCP improvements and then measure with real-user metrics in production.
- I already suppressed noisy analytics errors during local server builds (this reduces false positives in build logs).

If you want, I can:
- Add an automated Lighthouse check in CI and fail a PR when LCP > 2.5s.
- Create small PRs for the quick wins (preload font/image + lazy-load third-party JS).
- Produce a bundle-analysis report and attach it to this summary.
