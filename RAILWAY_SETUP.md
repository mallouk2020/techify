# 🚂 Railway Database Setup - Complete ✅

## ✅ What We Did:

### 1. Created PostgreSQL Database on Railway
- Database URL: `postgresql://postgres:***@mainline.proxy.rlwy.net:12269/railway`
- Provider: PostgreSQL (switched from MySQL)

### 2. Updated Project Files
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Changed provider from `mysql` to `postgresql`
- ✅ `.env` - Updated DATABASE_URL to Railway PostgreSQL
- ✅ Created migrations and synced database schema

### 3. Database Tables Created
All tables are now created on Railway:
- ✅ Product
- ✅ Image
- ✅ User
- ✅ Customer_order
- ✅ customer_order_product
- ✅ Category
- ✅ Wishlist

## 🚀 Next Steps: Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Switch to PostgreSQL on Railway"
git push
```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

Add these variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:wsjDmiydmSrKGhgENkHtbkYtUsDuAyMk@mainline.proxy.rlwy.net:12269/railway

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=12D16C923BA17672F89B18C1DB22A

NEXTAUTH_URL=https://techify-beta.vercel.app

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Important:** Make sure to add these to **ALL environments** (Production, Preview, Development)

### Step 3: Redeploy on Vercel

After adding environment variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"** button

OR just push to GitHub and Vercel will auto-deploy.

## ✅ What Will Work After Deployment:

- ✅ Website will load without errors
- ✅ NextAuth authentication (Login/Register)
- ✅ Database connections
- ✅ User management

## ⚠️ What Won't Work Yet:

- ⚠️ Products won't display (Express API not deployed)
- ⚠️ Product images won't load
- ⚠️ Shopping cart API calls will fail

---

## 🔜 Next Phase: Deploy Express Server

After Vercel deployment works, we need to:

1. Deploy Express server (from `/server` directory) to Railway
2. Get the Express server URL (e.g., `https://your-api.railway.app`)
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel to point to deployed Express server
4. Redeploy Vercel

## 📝 Important Notes:

### Database Connection String Format:
```
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
```

### Railway PostgreSQL Details:
- Host: `mainline.proxy.rlwy.net`
- Port: `12269`
- Database: `railway`
- User: `postgres`

### Security:
- ⚠️ Never commit `.env` file to GitHub
- ⚠️ Keep your DATABASE_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET private
- ✅ Use Vercel's environment variables for production

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### If Vercel deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel logs for specific error
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure DATABASE_URL is accessible from Vercel (Railway should allow external connections)

### If database connection fails:
1. Verify Railway database is running
2. Check if Railway allows external connections (should be enabled by default)
3. Test connection locally first: `npx prisma studio`

## ✅ Current Status:

- ✅ PostgreSQL database created on Railway
- ✅ Schema migrated successfully
- ✅ Local build successful
- ⏳ Ready to deploy to Vercel
- ⏳ Express server deployment pending
